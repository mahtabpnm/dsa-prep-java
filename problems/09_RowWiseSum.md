# Row-wise Sum of a 2D Matrix

## roblem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix `A` of integers.

Your task is to compute the sum of elements in each row and return a 1D array where each element represents the sum of a corresponding row in the matrix.

---

##Problem Constraints

- 1 <= A.size() <= 10^3
- 1 <= A[i].size() <= 10^3
- 1 <= A[i][j] <= 10^3

---

## 📥 Input Format

The first argument `A` is a 2D array of integers (2D matrix).

---

## 📤 Output Format

Return an array containing row-wise sums of the original matrix.

---

## Example Input

```
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 2, 3, 4]
]
```

---

## Example Output

```
[10, 26, 18]
```

---

## Example Explanation

Row 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
Row 2 = 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26  
Row 3 = 9 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 18
