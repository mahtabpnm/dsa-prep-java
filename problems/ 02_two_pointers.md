# Problem 02 — Find All Pairs With Target Sum (Two Pointers)

## Problem Statement

You are given:

- A sorted integer array `nums`
- An integer `target`

Return all unique pairs `(a, b)` such that:

a + b == target

Each pair must use different indices.

You must solve it in O(n) time.

## Example

Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
target = 6

Output:
[(2, 4)]

---

## Constraints

- The array is sorted.
- Do not use nested loops.
- Use the two pointers technique.
